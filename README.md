## Run Locally

1. Clone the project

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshay0831/Institution-Accreditation-and-Automation-System.git

2. Run the appropriate script based on your operating system:

   **Windows:** Double-click on the `runApp.bat` file in the project root directory.

   **Linux/MacOS:** Open a terminal window, navigate to the project root directory, and run the command `./runApp.sh`.

   The script will automatically install the necessary dependencies and start the backend and frontend servers.

3. Once the script is finished running, you can access the web application by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. The backend server is already configured to communicate with the MongoDB and Firebase Firestore databases.

**Note:** If you encounter any issues while running the script, make sure that you have the necessary dependencies installed on your system, such as Node.js and npm.
